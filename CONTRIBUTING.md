# CONTRIBUTING

## Welcome to the "Social GPT" Open Source Project!

First off, thank you for considering contributing to "Social GPT". It's people like you that make "Social GPT" such a great tool.

We welcome any type of contribution, not only code. You can help with
- **Quality Assurance**: file bug reports, the more details you can give the better (e.g. screenshots with the console open)
- **User Interface**: report on our usability, suggest improvements
- **Documentation**: create or modify existing documents. Improve our language and technical accuracy
- **Code**: take a look at our outstanding issues. Even a tiny pull request (like fixing a typo in the docs) contributes to the project and shows your support.

# Ground Rules
Our goal is to create a safe and friendly environment for our contributors. Please follow these guidelines:

1. Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
2. Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
3. Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/).

# Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to "Social GPT"? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues](https://github.com/social-gpt/agent/labels/beginner) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/social-gpt/agent/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this free series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions).

# Getting started

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Send a pull request indicating that you have a CLA on file.

## How to report a bug

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of the project are you using?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Social GPT, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Additional Notes

Please ensure that you use the latest version of the software before reporting bugs. In addition, please be sure to provide as much information as possible when describing bugs and issues. This greatly helps us in tracking down and fixing problems.

Also, please be patient with the review process. Everyone involved with the project works on it in their spare time, and as such, may not be able to immediately review your contribution. Rest assured, though, that if you've submitted it, we've received it and will get to it as soon as we can.

# Acknowledgements

Again, thank you for your time and consideration in contributing to Social GPT. Open source projects like this one grow and thrive through the hard work and dedication of contributors like you. Your work is greatly appreciated!
